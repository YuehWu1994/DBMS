# Database-Management-System

- This is the course project of Principles of Data Management taken place at UC, Irvine on Fall 2018. Me and another teammate developed a Database Management System API from scratch by 6000+ lines of C++ code. 

- The API supports **B+ Tree Index Manager**(/ix), **Query Operator Engine**(/qe), **Record-Based File Manager**(/rbf) and **Relation Manager**(/rm).
