# Database-Management-System

- This is the course project of Principles of Data Management (CS222) in Fall 2018. Me and another teammate developed a Database Management System API from scratch by 6000+ lines of C++ code. 

- The API supports B+ Tree Index Manager, Query Operator Engine, Record-Based File Manager and Relation Manager.
